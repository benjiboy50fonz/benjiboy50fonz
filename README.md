# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name's Ben, but to be honest, I am a man of many names, including, but not limited to: Merge Conflict, Gucci, and [The Questionable Programmer](https://thequestionableprogrammer.blogspot.com/). I primarily work with my high school robotics team, @FRC2539, but I also do other side projects myself, including Reddit Bots, FRC-related development, and any other projects revolving around exciting APIs! I also take great interest in programming solutions to mathematical problems. I often take the mathematical approach when problem-solving!

I also enjoy developing and developing in Linux systems, primarily **Arch**, Manjaro, and Mint! 

I'm always looking for an adventure, a challenge, or a cool new Linux OS!

## More about me:

I'm a college freshman studying computer engineering with a specialization in embedded systems. Although programming and developing software is my passion, I also greatly enjoy electronics and robotics! I am currently attending Michigan Technological University!

Although I spend a lot of time staring at a screen, I do enjoy getting outdoors and doing activites such as running, shooting, skiing, and snowmobiling whenever I can!
