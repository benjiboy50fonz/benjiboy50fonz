# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name's Ben, but to be honest, I am a man of many names, including, but not limited to: Merge Conflict, Gucci, and [The Questionable Programmer](https://thequestionableprogrammer.blogspot.com/). I primarily work with my high school robotics team, @FRC2539, but I also do other side projects myself, including Reddit Bots, FRC-related development, and any other projects revolving around exciting APIs!

I also enjoy developing and developing in Linux systems, primarily **Arch**, Manjaro, and Mint! 

I'm always looking for an adventure, a challenge, or a cool new Linux OS!

## More about me:

I'm a high school senior looking to go to college for computer engineering with a specialization in embedded systems. Although programming and developing (primarily robots!) is my passion, I also greatly enjoy electronics and robotics! I plan on attending Michigan Technological University in the fall of 2021. 

Although I spend a lot of time inside staring at a screen, I do enjoy getting outdoors and doing activites such as running, shooting, skiing, and snowmobiling whenever I can!
